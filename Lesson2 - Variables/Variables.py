#Variables are containers for storing data values. (string, integer,float, boolean)
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

#string
first_name = "John"
last_name ="Doe"

#integer
age = 20

#float
salary = 3045.56

#bool
married = False

print(f"Your name is {first_name} {last_name}")
print(f"Your age is {age} and your salary is {salary}")
print(f"Your mariatal status is {married}")


x=5
print(x) # will print 5
x="apple"
print(x) # now it will print apple
